= Why is PHP Console Log not working? =

The most common reasons that cause PHP Console Log to fail when logging your information to the web console are:

1. **Cause:**
The PHP Console log plugin is not activated.

 **Solution:**
Activate the PHP Console Log Plugin.

2. **Cause:**
Another plugin has changed the order in which your plugins load. Making the PHP Console Log functions not available yet.

 **Solution:**
PHP Console Log updates the order in which plugins are loaded any time a plugin is activated or deactivated. However, it is still possible for other plugins to change the order in which plugins load afterwards. Deactivate any plugins that change the order in which your plugins load.

3. **Cause:**
do_action( 'php_console_log', 'My String or Array' ); was called inside a block of code that was not run.

 **Solution:**
Make sure the function you called do_action( 'php_console_log', 'My String or Array' ); in is run via an action or filter hook such as: add_action( 'init', 'my_function' ); Or call do_action( 'php_console_log', 'My String or Array' ); outside of any other functions in a file that you know is run.

4. **Cause:**
PHP throws errors. Side Note: Make sure you are using define( 'WP_DEBUG', true ); in your wp-config.php file so you can see PHP errors.

 **Solution:**
Fix the error that PHP is showing you. Then try again.
